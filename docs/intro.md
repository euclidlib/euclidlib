# euclidlib: A library for reading cosmology-ready Euclid products

`euclidlib` is an **unofficial** Python package developed to facilitate access to data products from the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org) Science Ground Segment.

The library provides straightforward tools for reading and writing Euclid data, making it easier to work with cosmological products related to Large-Scale Structure.

> **Note**
> This package is maintained on a best-effort basis by volunteers and contributors from the Euclid community.
