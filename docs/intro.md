# euclidlib: a library to read Euclid products

`euclidlib` is an **unofficial** Python package designed to simplify the process of reading **official** [Euclid](https://eas.esac.esa.int) mission products from the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org) Science Ground Segment.

Our mission is to empower the Euclid community with a user-friendly, ready-to-use library that enables seamless interaction with science-ready Euclid data. Whether you're a versed Euclid researcher or just getting started, `euclidlib` aims to make working with Euclid products easier and more efficient. 

Yet, the power `euclidlib` extends beyond Euclid. With user-friendly reading and writing routines, `euclidlib` enables to overall work with Large-Scale Structure cosmological products.
